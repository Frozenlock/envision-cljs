* envision-cljs

  A clojurescript wrapper for the [[https://github.com/HumbleSoftware/envisionjs][Envision.js]] library

  (Click [[http://www.humblesoftware.com/envision][here]] for examples)
  
** Usage
   
   Add =[org.clojars.frozenlock/envision-cljs "0.1.1-SNAPSHOT"]= to your
   project dependencies.

   You will also need to add the envision.js or envision.min.js in the
   head of your webpage. Unfortunately it doesn't work with the google
   closure compiler.

   For full goodies, also add the envision.min.css!

   All the envision stuff can be found on the  [[https://github.com/HumbleSoftware/envisionjs][envision repository]].
   


   The wrapper takes care of converting clj maps to javascript, so you
   can use clojure hash-maps directly!
   
   Either use the =timeseries= function directly, or build your own
   graph making function.
   
   An example of how to build the data/config is shown with the
   function =add-demo-graph=. (If you want to run it, make sure you
   have a DIV with the id "graph" in your page")
