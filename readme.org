* envision-cljs

  A clojurescript wrapper for the [[https://github.com/HumbleSoftware/envisionjs][Envision.js]] library
  
  [[./envision-cljs/raw/master/graph.png]]
  (Click [[http://www.humblesoftware.com/envision][here]] for examples)
  
** Usage
   
   The wrapper takes care of converting clj maps to javascript, so you
   can use clojure hash-maps directly!
   
   Either use the =timeseries= function directly, or build your own
   graph making function.
   
   An example of how to build the data/config is shown with the
   function =add-demo-graph=. (If you want to run it, make sure you
   have a DIV with the id "graph" in your page")
